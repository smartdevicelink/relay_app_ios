# SmartDeviceLink (SDL) iOS Relay

SDL iOS Relay is a tool built for developers building applications
that utilizes SmartDeviceLink for connecting their apps to technologies using
our [SmartDeviceLink Core](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_core) connected
via USB. This tool allows those developers to test their applications over a TCP/IP connection, allowing developers to easily see debug logs to make development faster
and easier.

### Things To Note
- Make sure that both SDL iOS Relay and your app are connected to the
**same** wifi network.


## Relay Status

#### Start

> Initial app startup. This state is visible when the app is not connected to
hardware running SDL Core via USB.

#### USB Connected

> When Relay is initially connected via USB, but the connection isn't complete.

#### EASession Connected

> When the Relay is fully connected via USB, and ready for server start.

#### Relay started

> Server is now started, and awating connection.


#### Connected to Relay

now be sent and received.

## How To Start Testing Using Relay

> ###### For all documentation purposes, we will be using our [SDL iOS Library](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_ios) for code snippets.

To get started, please be sure to use the SDLLifecycleConfiguration's [TCP/IP initializer](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_ios/blob/master/SmartDeviceLink/SDLLifecycleConfiguration.h#L47).

Objective-C:

```objective-c
	SDLLifecycleConfiguration *lifecycle = [SDLLifecycleConfiguration debugConfigurationWithAppName:<#(nonnull NSString *)#> appId:<#(nonnull NSString *)#> ipAddress:@"1.2.3.4" port:2776];
	SDLLockScreenConfiguration *lockscreen = [SDLLockScreenConfiguration enabledConfiguration];
	SDLLogConfiguration *logConfiguration = [SDLLogConfiguration debugConfiguration];
    SDLConfiguration *configuration = [[SDLConfiguration alloc] initWithLifecycle:lifecycle lockScreen:lockscreen logging:logConfiguration];
	self.sdlManager = [[SDLManager alloc] initWithConfiguration:configuration delegate:<#(nullable id<SDLManagerDelegate>)#>];
```

Swift:
```swift
	let lifeCycle = SDLLifecycleConfiguration(appName: <#T##String#>, appId: String, ipAddress: "1.2.3.4", port: UInt16(2776))
	let config = SDLConfiguration(lifecycle: lifeCycle, lockScreen: .enabled(), logging: .debug())
	self.sdlManager = SDLManager(configuration: config, delegate: <#T##SDLManagerDelegate?#>)
```

> NOTE: Be sure to start the Relay app **before** connecting your application to it.
